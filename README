Getting started is simple.

1. Install http://github.com/jeffrafter/rubygsm/tree/master, http://github.com/taf2/curb/tree/master
2. Edit wpf.yml with correct details
3. Run incoming.rb and outgoing.rb, possibly in a screen session
   These processes will send and receive SMS.
4. run wpf.rb - this will start a sinatra web service. Post to
   /messages w/ the correct params (see the model) and it will
   queue up a message to be sent out.
